# sum-of-prime-factors-function
Python algorithm for a mathematical iteration problem on prime factors. It is weakly related to the Goldbach conjecture.

If n is prime, double n. If n is composite, subtract the sum of the prime factors. Continue this procedure until you reach a cycle or 1.

The assumption is that there are no further cycles (except 2,4,...). This algorithm tries to find counterexamples.
